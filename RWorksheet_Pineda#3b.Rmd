## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#On this day, July 14th, negative sentiments outnumber all other sentiments. This signifies that some topics or occurrences got negative sentiments on that particular day.

#Even though all sentiments increased on this day, July 15th, negative sentiments remained at their peak. This implies that something happened on that day that triggered unfavorable feelings.

#On these days, July 17th and 18th, negative attitudes are high, whereas neutral and positive sentiments are similar.

#On July 20th, all sentiments reached their lowest point, albeit there were still more negative sentiments among the others. This demonstrates that nothing happened that day.

#On this day, July 21st, all sentiments rise, with the negative dominating. This could imply that something happened that day that prompted negative responses from the people.

#We can conclude from this data that public sentiment is open to external forces and that it evolves over time.
